These are my personal dotfiles. I'm putting them on github mostly to have a backup, and an easy way of getting them on a new machine. You're welcome to look through these files, see if you notice something useful. If you have any suggestions, improvements or tips, feel free to contact me.

Please note that portions of these files go back a while, and may not have been maintained properly. Later additions may have broken something after I'd stopped using it, and some things never really worked properly to begin with. YMMV

In the case of Vim, I've only recently started using Vundle (for shame!), and I haven't converted completely yet, due to being a lazy piece of ****.
